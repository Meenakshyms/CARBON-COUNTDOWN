        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
            This project is part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge, focused on uncovering the role of greenhouse gases in our neighborhood. 
            Greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our interactive webpage allows users to explore the global impacts of these gases. By selecting different years, users can see NASA's data on temperature rise, sea level increase, and other environmental changes over time.
            The project not only raises awareness but also offers actionable steps that individuals can take to reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change.
        </p>

            Additionally, a game feature helps to engage users in a fun and educational way, encouraging positive environmental action through gamification.
